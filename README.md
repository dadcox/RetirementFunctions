# Retirement

This page is for instructions on how to use the shared-retirement spreadsheet.  This spreadsheet is designed to help provide projections on different scenarios for managing retirement income.  The shared spreadsheet can be found [here](https://google.com/sheets).  This location is simply your personal repository of google spreadsheets.  When the `shared-retirement` spreadsheet is shared with you it will become visible in your personal repository.

## Important Note
The Shared-Retirement spreadsheet is just as it is named, **shared**.  This means, if you update the sheet in its current location, you will be allowing anyone else that has access to see your information.  So, I would strongly suggest you clone the sheet prior to using it.  That will ensure it is private for your use only.  To copy the Shared-Retirement spreadsheet to a local, personal copy, simply open the Shared-Retirement spreadsheet and click `File>Make a copy`.

## How to use
At the high level, the spreadsheet uses the `data` tab to as input.  Behind the scenes is a script that takes the input from the `data` sheet and creates a new sheet (aka `tab`) to display the results.  Clicking the `Create Projection` button will generate the new sheet.  The name of the page is determined by the content of the `Name` field on the `data` sheet.  Most of the input fields on the `data` sheet are self-explanatory.  Below is an attempt to clarify some of the details for these values.

### *Total retirement savings*
This is the total of your savings, 401k, stocks, bonds and any other source of financial assets you plan on using to fund your retirement.  

### *Estimated savings yearly rate of return*
This is the rate you estimate you will receive on your retirment savings.  This of course could vary wildly depending on your investment selections (stocks, bonds, CDs).  There isn't a great way to figure this out, so, i tend to err on the side of caution.  

### *Inflation*
This is really just a rate that you can use to increase your monthly income value(s) year over year.  It isn't a value that tries to guess what real inflation will be, but rather gives you a mechanism to increase your income year over year.

### *Desired Monthly Income*
This section should be used to define your monthly income amounts.  The purpose of having multiple input rows is to allow for a change in income from one year to the next. 

### *Social Security*
This section allows you to identify when you will start receiving social security and how much you will receive.  There are multiple lines, but I don't expect you would use more than two for a couple (unless you turned 62 prior to 2015).  

### *Other Income*
Here you can add other sources of income.  For instance, if you have a pension or an annuity.
